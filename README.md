# Image-Caption-Generator

Python Implementation of an encoder-decoder based image caption generator.

encoder - computer vision side
decoder - natural language processing side

Using Inception-v3 the features of the images are extracted.

Word embeddings are applied to express tokens as meaningful vectors.

Multi-layer Gated Recurrent Units are utilized to extract arbitrary time-series feature extraction.

Using a fully connected layer the words are classified for given features.
